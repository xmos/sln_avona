Overview
********

The estimated power usage of the example application, while in `POWER_STATE_FULL`, varies from 100-141 mW. This will vary based on component tolerances and any user added code and/or user added compile options.

By default, the application will startup using a system frequency of 600 MHz which will consume around 141 mW. After startup, `tile[1]` clock divider is enabled and set to 3 bringing the tile's frequency down to 300 MHz, where it will consume around 114 mW. Tile frequencies lower than this may lead to application instability. When the application enters `POWER_STATE_LOW`, the `tile[0]` clock frequency will be divided by 600 and the switch clock frequency by 30 bringing the frequencies to 1 MHz and 20 MHz, respectively. This low power state consumes around 55 mW.

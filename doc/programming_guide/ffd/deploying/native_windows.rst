Deploying the Firmware with Native Windows
******************************************

This document explains how to deploy the software using `CMake` and `NMake`. If you are not using native Windows MSVC build tools and instead using a Linux emulation tool such as WSL, refer to :doc:`Deploying the Firmware with Linux or macOS <linux_macos>`.

Building the Host Applications
==============================

This application requires a host application to create the flash data partition. Run the following commands in the root folder to build the host application using your native Toolchain:

.. note::

  Permissions may be required to install the host applications.

Before building the host application, you will need to add the path to the XTC Tools to your environment.

.. code-block:: console

  set "XMOS_TOOL_PATH=<path-to-xtc-tools>"

Then build the host application:

.. code-block:: console

  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build_host
  cd build_host
  nmake install

The host applications will be install at ``<USERPROFILE>\.xmos\bin``, and may be moved if desired.  You may wish to add this directory to your ``PATH`` variable.

Building the Firmware
=====================

Run the following commands in the root folder to build the firmware:

.. code-block:: console

    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
    cd build
    nmake example_ffd

Running the Firmware
====================

Before running the firmware, the filesystem and model must be flashed to the data partition.

Within the root of the build folder, run:

.. code-block:: console

    nmake flash_app_example_ffd

After this command completes, the application will be running.

After flashing the data partition, the application can be run without reflashing. If changes are made to the data partition components, the application must be reflashed.

From the build folder run:

.. code-block:: console

    nmake run_example_ffd

Debugging the Firmware
======================

To debug with xgdb, from the build folder run:

.. code-block:: console

    nmake debug_example_ffd

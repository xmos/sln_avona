Overview
========
This is the XMOS far-field voice local command (FFD) reference design with Wanson speech recognition and local dictionary.

When a wakeup phrase is followed by an intent phrase the application will output an audio response, |I2C| and uart discrete message, and display text on the optional SSD1306 daughter board.

This software is an evaluation version only.  It includes a mechanism that limits the maximum number of recognitions to 50. You can reset the counter to 0 by restarting or rebooting the application.  The application can be rebooted by power cycling or pressing the SW2 button.

More information on the Wanson speech recognition library can be found here: :ref:`sln_voice_Wanson`

Supported Hardware
------------------

This example application is supported on the `XK-VOICE-L71 <https://www.digikey.co.uk/en/products/detail/xmos/XK-VOICE-L71/15761172>`_ board.

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

This example design requires an XTAG4 and XK-VOICE-L71 board.

Optionally, an external microphone array board, LCD daugher board, and SSD1306 display can also be used.

External Microphone Array (OPTIONAL)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An external microphone array can be used instead of the on board mics by connecting one, as shown below.

Open the MIC EXP connector lock.

Building the Firmware
---------------------

Run the following commands in the root folder to build the firmware:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
        cd build
        make example_ffd

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
        cd build
        nmake example_ffd

Configuring the Firmware
------------------------

The default application performs as described in the Overview. There are numerous compile time options that can be added to change the example design without requiring code changes.  To change the options explained in the table below, add the desired configuration variables to the APP_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS cmake variable located `here <https://github.com/xmos/sln_voice/blob/develop/examples/ffd/ffd.cmake>`_.

If options are changed, the application firmware must be rebuilt.

Running the Firmware
--------------------

Before the firmware is run, the filesystem must be loaded.

Inside of the build folder root, after building the firmware:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        make flash_fs_example_ffd

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        nmake flash_fs_example_ffd

Once flashed, the application will run.

After the filesystem has been flashed once, the application can be run without flashing.  If changes are made to the filesystem image, the application must be reflashed.

From the build folder run:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        make run_example_ffd

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        nmake run_example_ffd

Debugging the Firmware
----------------------

To debug with xgdb, from the build folder run:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        make debug_example_ffd

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        nmake debug_example_ffd


Host Integration
===================

This example application can be integrated with existing solutions or modified to be a single controller solution.

Out of the Box Integration

Single Controller Solution
--------------------------

In depth information on the software implementation for users to familiarize themselves with the application before modifying it can be found here:
:ref:`sln_voice_ffd_software_description`

Additionally, information on how to replace major modules, such as the intent handling block, can be found here: :ref:`sln_voice_ffd_modifying_software`

   :alt: ffd host direct control diagram


Design Architecture
===================

The application consists of a PDM microphone input, which is fed through the XMOS-VOICE DSP blocks.  The output ASR channel is then sent to the Wanson keyword engine.  The intent result is then handled, with discrete messaging to various IO interfaces and audio playback.

========
Overview
========

This is the XCORE-VOICE far-field voice assistant example design.

This application can be used out of the box as a voice processor solution, or expanded to run local wakeword engines.

This application features a full duplex acoustic echo cancellation stage, which can be provided reference audio via |I2S| or USB audio.  An audio output ASR stream is also available via |I2S| or USB audio.

Supported Hardware
------------------

This example application is supported on the `XK-VOICE-L71 <https://www.digikey.co.uk/en/products/detail/xmos/XK-VOICE-L71/15761172>`_ board.

-----------------------
Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

This example design requires an XTAG4 and XK-VOICE-L71 board.

---------------------
Building the Firmware
---------------------

Run the following commands in the root folder to build the |I2S| firmware:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
        cd build
        make example_ffva_int_adec

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
        cd build
        nmake example_ffva_int_adec


Run the following commands in the root folder to build the USB firmware:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
        cd build
        make example_ffva_ua_adec

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
        cd build
        nmake example_ffva_ua_adec

--------------------
Running the Firmware
--------------------

Before the firmware is run, the filesystem must be loaded.

Inside of the build folder root, after building the firmware, run one of:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        make flash_fs_example_ffva_int_adec
        make flash_fs_example_ffva_ua_adec

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        nmake flash_fs_example_ffva_int_adec
        nmake flash_fs_example_ffva_ua_adec

Once flashed, the application will run.

After the filesystem has been flashed once, the application can be run without flashing.  If changes are made to the filesystem image, the application must be reflashed.

From the build folder run:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        make run_example_ffva_int_adec
        make run_example_ffva_ua_adec

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        nmake run_example_ffva_int_adec
        nmake run_example_ffva_ua_adec

----------------------
Upgrading the Firmware
----------------------

The UA variants of this application contain DFU over the USB DFU Class V1.1 transport method.

To create an upgrade image from the build folder run:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        make create_upgrade_img_example_ffva_ua_adec
        make create_upgrade_img_example_ffva_ua_adec_altarch

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        nmake create_upgrade_img_example_ffva_ua_adec
        nmake create_upgrade_img_example_ffva_ua_adec_altarch

Once the application is running, a USB DFU v1.1 tool can be used to perform various actions.  This example will demonstrate with dfu-util commands.  Installation instructions for respective operating system can be found `here <https://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/>`__

To verify the device is running run:

.. code-block:: console

    dfu-util -l

This should result in an output containing:

.. code-block:: console

    Found DFU: [20b1:0020] ver=0001, devnum=100, cfg=1, intf=3, path="3-4.3", alt=2, name="DFU DATAPARTITION", serial="123456"
    Found DFU: [20b1:0020] ver=0001, devnum=100, cfg=1, intf=3, path="3-4.3", alt=1, name="DFU UPGRADE", serial="123456"
    Found DFU: [20b1:0020] ver=0001, devnum=100, cfg=1, intf=3, path="3-4.3", alt=0, name="DFU FACTORY", serial="123456"

The DFU interprets the flash as 3 separate partitions, the read only factory image, the read/write upgrade image, and the read/write data partition containing the filesystem.

The factory image can be read back by running:

.. code-block:: console

    dfu-util -e -d 0020 -a 0 -U readback_factory_img.bin

The factory image can not be written to.

From the build folder, the upgrade image can be written by running:

.. code-block:: console

    dfu-util -e -d 0020 -a 1 -D example_ffva_ua_adec_upgrade.bin
    dfu-util -e -d 0020 -a 1 -D example_ffva_ua_adec_altarch_upgrade.bin

The upgrade image can be read back by running:

.. code-block:: console

    dfu-util -e -d 0020 -a 1 -U readback_upgrade_img.bin

On system reboot, the upgrade image will always be loaded if valid.  If the upgrade image is invalid, the factory image will be loaded.  To revert back to the factory image, you can upload an file containing the word 0xFFFFFFFF.

The data partition image can be read back by running:

.. code-block:: console

    dfu-util -e -d 0020 -a 2 -U readback_data_partition_img.bin

The data partition image can be written by running:

.. code-block:: console

    dfu-util -e -d 0020 -a 2 -D readback_data_partition_img.bin

Note that the data partition will always be at the address specified in the initial flashing call.

----------------------
Debugging the Firmware
----------------------

To debug with xgdb, from the build folder run:

.. tab:: Linux and Mac

    .. code-block:: console

        make debug_example_int_adec
        make debug_example_ua_adec

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

        nmake debug_example_int_adec
        nmake debug_example_ua_adec

================
Host Integration
================

This example application can be integrated with existing solutions or modified to be a single controller solution.

--------------------------
Out of the Box Integration
--------------------------

Out of the box integration varies cased on configuration.

INT requires |I2S| connections to the host.  Refer to the schematic, connecting the host reference audio playback to the ADC I2S and the host input audio to the DAC |I2S|.  Out of the box, the INT configuration requires an externally generated MCLK of 12.288 MHz.  24.576 MHz is also supported and can be changed via the compile option MIC_ARRAY_CONFIG_MCLK_FREQ, found in ffva_int.cmake.

UA requires a USB connection to the host.

--------------------------
Single Controller Solution
--------------------------

In a single controller solution, a user can populate the model runner manager task with the application specific code.

This dummy thread receives only the ASR channel output, which has been downshifted to 16 bits.

The user must ensure that the streambuffer is emptied at at least the rate of the audio pipeline, otherwise samples will be lost.

Populate:

.. code-block:: c
    :caption: Model Runner Dummy (model_runner.c)

    void model_runner_manager(void *args)
    {
        StreamBufferHandle_t input_queue = (StreamBufferHandle_t)args;

        int16_t buf[appconfWW_FRAMES_PER_INFERENCE];

        /* Perform any initialization here */

        while (1)
        {
            /* Receive audio frames */
            uint8_t *buf_ptr = (uint8_t*)buf;
            size_t buf_len = appconfWW_FRAMES_PER_INFERENCE * sizeof(int16_t);
            do {
                size_t bytes_rxed = xStreamBufferReceive(input_queue,
                                                         buf_ptr,
                                                         buf_len,
                                                         portMAX_DELAY);
                buf_len -= bytes_rxed;
                buf_ptr += bytes_rxed;
            } while(buf_len > 0);

            /* Perform inference here */
            // rtos_printf("inference\n");
        }
    }

===================
Design Architecture
===================

The application consists of a PDM microphone input, which is fed through the XMOS-VOICE DSP blocks.  The output ASR channel is then output over |I2S| or USB.
